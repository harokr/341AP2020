This reposity shows all the documentation for a musical note FFT created in November - December 2020.
The requirements for the project are as follows:

This FFT should be able to read a musical note between middle and high C (ignoring sharps and flats) and turn on one LED based on the note played.
The system must collect 20 samples per period for every frequency.
The system should be able to detect notes at least 10 feet away.
The system should also have less than 0.2 volts of amplitude when not stimulated and more than 1 volt when it is stimulated.
The system should have a minimum SNR of 20.

The report shows the results of this system, all code used for the project, as well as the power vs frequency spectrum.
